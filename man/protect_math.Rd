\item{ns}{an XML namespace object (defaults: \code{\link[=md_ns]{md_ns()}}).}
}

\description{
Protect math elements from commonmark's character escape
}
\details{
Commonmark does not know what LaTeX is and will LaTeX equations as
normal text. This means that content surrounded by underscores are
interpreted as \verb{<emph>} elements and all backslashes are escaped by default.
This function protects inline and block math elements that use \code{$} and \verb{$$}
for delimiters, respectively.
}
\note{
this function is also a method in the \link{yarn} object.

\examples{
m <- tinkr::to_xml(system.file("extdata", "math-example.md", package = "tinkr"))
txt <- textConnection(tinkr::to_md(m))
cat(tail(readLines(txt)), sep = "\n") # broken math
close(txt)
protect_math(m$body)
txt <- textConnection(tinkr::to_md(m))
cat(tail(readLines(txt)), sep = "\n") # fixed math
close(txt)
