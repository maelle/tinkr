## R Markdown

This is an ~~R Markdown document~~. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{python, fig.cap = "pretty plot", echo=-c(1, 2), eval = TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{python}
plot(pressure)
```

Non-RMarkdown blocks are also considered

```bash
echo "this is an unevaluted bash block"
```

```
This is an ambiguous code block
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
