```{r, message=FALSE, thing=c(1, 2)}
#| echo: no
#| fig.width: 10.0
#| fig.cap: This is a long caption.

plot(cars)
```

This is a chunk for julia that has nested options, which would appear as R objects in a normal chunk.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-plots
#| fig.cap: Multiple Plots
#| fig.alt:
#| - 'A blue arc: labelled as y1 that starts at 0,0 and ends at 0.9,-0.75'
#| - 'A blue curve: labelled as y1 twisted like a pretzel'
#| layout-ncol: 2

using Plots
display(plot(sin, x -> sin(2x), 0, 2))
display(plot(x -> sin(4x), y -> sin(5y), 0, 2))
```
